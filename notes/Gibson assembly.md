A molecular cloning method that allows for the **joining of multiple DNA fragments in a single, isothermal reaction**.

1. DNA fragments with complementary 3' regions are placed in a solution
2. 5'-3' exonuclease creates single stranded 3' overhangs
3. 3' ends hybridize together to form a double-stranded molecule
4. DNA polymerase extends 3' ends, filling up the gaps
5. Ligases fill up remaining gaps
