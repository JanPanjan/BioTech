A **binary [[Plasmid|vector]]** is a standard tool in the transformation of higher plants mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. 

It is composed of:
- the borders of T-DNA
- multiple cloning sites
- replication functions for Escherichia coli and A. tumefaciens
- selectable marker genes
- reporter genes
- other accessory elements that can improve the efficiency of and/or give further capability to the system.

A **super-binary vector** carries **additional virulence genes** from a Ti plasmid, and exhibits **very high frequency of transformation**, which is valuable for recalcitrant plants such as cereals. 

A number of useful vectors are widely circulated. Whereas vectors with **compatible selectable markers** and **convenient cloning sites** are usually the top criteria **when inserting gene fragments shorter than 15 kb**, the capability of maintaining a large DNA piece is more important for consideration when introducing DNA fragments larger than 15 kb. 

Because no vector is perfect for every project, it is recommended that modification or construction of vectors should be made according to the objective of the experiments. Existing vectors serve as good sources of components.
