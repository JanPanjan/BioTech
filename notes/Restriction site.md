In [molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology "Molecular biology"), **restriction sites**, or **restriction recognition sites**, are regions of a [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") molecule containing specific (4-8 [base pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair "Base pair") in length) sequences of [nucleotides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide "Nucleotide"). These are recognized by [restriction enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme "Restriction enzyme"), which cleave the DNA at or near the site. 

These are generally [palindromic sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_sequence "Palindromic sequence") (because restriction enzymes usually bind as [homodimers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homodimer "Homodimer")), and a particular restriction enzyme may cut the sequence between two nucleotides within its recognition site, or somewhere nearby.
