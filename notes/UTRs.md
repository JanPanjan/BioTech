==Untranslated regions (UTRs)== refer to sections on the ends of a coding sequence on a mRNA strand, either 3'-UTR (trailer sequence) or 5'-UTR (leader sequence).

- 5'-UTR being upstream of the coding sequence contains a sequence that is recognized by the ribosome, which then binds to it and initiates translation. It can also contain an **upstream open reading frame (uORF)** that can be translated into peptides.
- 3'-UTR is found immeadiatelly after the stop codon

### Difference between non-coding and untranslated

It's important to differentiate UTRs and introns - the latter are removed during RNA splicing and are not part of the mature mRNA that will undergo translation, which is why they are considered **non-protein-coding RNA**.

### Conservation

In prokaryotes 5'-UTR is usually between 3 and 10 bp, while in eukaryotes it can be 100s-1000s bp long. It has been seen that the 5'-UTR length is more conserved than the 3'-UTR ^[https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fmolbev%2Fmsr143]
