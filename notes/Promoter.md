A **promoter** is a sequence of DNA to which [[Proteini in peptidi|proteins]] bind to initiate transcription of a **single RNA transcript** from the DNA downstream of the promoter.

They are located near the transcription start sites of genes, **upstream** on the DNA (towards the 5' region of the [[Sense strand]]).

They can be about 100–1000 bp long, the sequence of which is highly dependent on:

- the gene and product of transcription
- type or class of RNA polymerase recruited to the site
- species of organism.

> **Top**: The transcription of the gene is turned off. There is no lactose to inhibit the repressor, so the repressor binds to the operator, which obstructs the RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and making the mRNA encoding the lactase gene.  
> 
> **Bottom**: The gene is turned on. Lactose is inhibiting the repressor, allowing the RNA polymerase to bind with the promoter and express the genes, which synthesize lactase. Eventually, the lactase will digest all of the lactose, until there is none to bind to the repressor. The repressor will then bind to the operator, stopping the manufacture of lactase.
