A **multiple cloning site** (also called a polylinker) is a short segment of DNA which contains many (up to ~20) restriction sites—a standard feature of engineered plasmids.

[[Restriction site|Restriction sites]] within an MCS are **typically unique, occurring only once within a given plasmid**. The purpose of an MCS in a plasmid is to allow a piece of DNA to be inserted into that region.
