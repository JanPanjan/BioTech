Flanking DNA sequences on a gene-editing template (like a [[Donor DNA cassette]]) that match the DNA region around a target site. They guide the [[Homology-directed repair|HDR]] machinery to insert, delete or replace specific DNA segments precisely where intended. 

Can range to tens of thousands of base pairs to ensure accurate targeting for knock-in/knock-out models.
